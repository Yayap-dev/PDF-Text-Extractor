# PDF-Text-Extractor
A PDF text extractor built using python to extract text on specific areas for multiple files

This code as mentioned above can read text in a PDF file by specifically selecting an area in a pdf then extract the texts on that area on multiple PDFs. The output would then be saved as Excel files. It works great on multiple PDF with the same PDF dimensions.


I am not a full-pledged coder so the code might look messy in the eyes of a coder. This is a simple tool to help me and my team in our daily tasks of scanning through PDFs. Regardless, the current capability of this code would suffice for what I had in mind when this was still an idea. It has helped me saved a lot of time and be more efficient, and I hope for those who will use this would also feel the same.

For the meantime, it cannot extract texts in an image due to limited time for coding. This might be done in future development propably by using pytesseract or other OCR modules available. There is no documentation on how to use it though I hope the UI would be easy to understand for usage to those who would use this.
